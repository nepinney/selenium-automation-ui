Note:
    *This config file will be used when testing application from jar because
     the referenced files will have different paths relative to the main work directory.
    *Idea with this is that the program will be able to get path at runtime to
     prepend to the file paths which are relative. If .jar and whatever file are in the same
     directory, then only need to write the file name in this config.
    *Changes made will be applied on next launch of program
    *DO NOT CHANGE FORMATTING OR ANYTHING LEFT OF SEMICOLONS
