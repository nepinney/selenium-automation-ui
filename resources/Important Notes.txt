When trying to get nested components to change size based on parent,
    -use GridPane, HBox, VBox or, preferably, to StackPane and ArchorPane as parent node.

When nesting fxml inside another
    -make sure that proper file structure is present (need packages) or fxml wont be able to find the class associated.

Run configurations (below) don't make a difference.
    --module-path C:\javafx-sdk-11.0.2\lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml

Libraries to add
JavaFX
    lib
Poi
    poi412
    commons-math3
    commons-collections4
Selenium
    lib
    2 other jars

When running:
    Jar: java -jar absolutePathToJar.jar
        All the required files must be in the same directory as the jar itself unless changes are made to the config.txt files

    On IntelliJ: Need to put required files into the out\production folder so that the program (in the work directory can access them)

What left to do:
    -Test ticket fetching abilities with various notes
    -Fix excel sheet creation with desktops
    -When creating local request emial, put the entire device model and sn rather than just sn.
    -Replace PC on confirmation template with variable for laptop or desktop
    -Fix johns cc email for confirmations - DONE
