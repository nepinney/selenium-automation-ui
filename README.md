# Selenium Automation UI

This program was created during my internship at CGI to automate repetitive daily tasks such as email creation from templates and Purolator waybill creation.

Written purely in Kotlin (by myself, after-hours), JavaFX and Selenium was used to create a UI in which I could set various options to preset browser executions.
