# Selenium Automation UI

This program was created during my internship at CGI to automate repetitive daily tasks such as email creation from templates and Purolator waybill creation.

Written purely in Kotlin (by myself, after-hours), JavaFX and Selenium was used to create a UI in which I could set various options to preset browser executions.

Features:
 * Fetch data from browser to create a outlook email file based on a text file containing email template.
 * Based on information from excel spreadsheet, automated purolator waybill creation

Why Kotlin?
 * Lovely syntax
 * Functional snippets
 * Wanted more experience with it
 * Cross-compatibility with Java (JVM)

Libraries/Frameworks
 * JavaFX
 * Maven
 * Selenium
 * ApachePOI
